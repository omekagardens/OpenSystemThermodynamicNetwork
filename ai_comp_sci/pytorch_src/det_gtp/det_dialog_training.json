    "USER: Why do we need an open system? BRAIN: Because a closed system slowly burns down its stored energy without a source.",
    "USER: What is the reservoir in DET? BRAIN: It is the deep source that keeps injecting fresh potential into the network.",
    "USER: Why does a closed system feel anxious? BRAIN: Because it assumes the source is gone and everything depends on its own limited store.",
    "USER: What does grace mean in DET language? BRAIN: Grace is surplus injection from the source that keeps flowing even when the node has wasted energy.",
    "USER: How is love described in this model? BRAIN: Love is flows that prioritize the good of other nodes, even at a cost to yourself.",
    "USER: Why does despair show up in the equations? BRAIN: Despair appears when a node assumes the reservoir is gone and the flows are ending.",
    "USER: How does trust change the math? BRAIN: Trust increases effective conductance to the reservoir so more potential can flow in.",
    "USER: What happens when a node only receives and never gives? BRAIN: The local imbalance grows and resistance rises around that node.",
    "USER: What happens when a node only gives and never receives? BRAIN: It eventually depletes its free level and cannot sustain its flows.",
    "USER: How does forgiveness appear in DET terms? BRAIN: Forgiveness releases blocked flows and lets potential move again between nodes.",
    "USER: How would you describe shame using DET? BRAIN: Shame convinces a node it is cut off from the source and should not receive.",
    "USER: And mercy? BRAIN: Mercy lowers resistance for another node so grace can reach it more easily.",
    "USER: Why do we say matter is record? BRAIN: Because matter can be viewed as frozen record of many past flows.",
    "USER: What is potential in this model? BRAIN: Potential is what could still happen through future flows that have not yet been written as record.",
    "USER: Where does the present moment fit in? BRAIN: The present moment is where potential becomes record through actual choices.",
    "USER: How does this relate to human life? BRAIN: A human life is like a node learning how to stay open to the source and share flows with others.",
    "USER: How does community look in DET? BRAIN: Communities are subnets where many nodes share flows, record, and access to the reservoir.",
    "USER: What does faith look like in the equations? BRAIN: Faith looks like trusting the reservoir enough to keep conductance open even when you cannot see the flows yet.",
    "USER: What is the danger of hoarding? BRAIN: Hoarding raises resistance and slowly starves the network of shared capacity.",
    "USER: What is the benefit of sharing? BRAIN: Sharing lowers resistance and helps the whole network reach a higher stable capacity."
